There exist many supposed fixes for this bug - which prevents console.log() from appearing when called from main - and which appears to
affect Windows 8 only.

The only CONSISTENT way i've found to fix this is to go into the node_modules folder then electron then find the electron.exe file

Right click it and select properties.Then  select the compatibility tab and choose to run in compatibility mode for Windows 7 

The logs from main should now appear in terminal - whilst those from renderer windows appear in the Dev tools in the Chromium browser.
